Hello, friend. I hope these words find you happy and healthy.
I'm João. I will very soon (hopefully) graduate with a Masters in Mathematics, and in the future I plan to be a PhD candidate in Maths as well.
I intend to present some (academic) projects related to data, risk and quantitative analysis. My goal is to both practice my Python, SQL and R skills as well as signaling to a potential employer that I do in fact possess some skills in those languages.
I'm interested in all things math related, and I might write some things related to specific subjects as time goes by.
Thank you for taking the time to read this, I really didn't deserve it. Take care. Look to both sides of the road before crossing. Have a nice day.
